            <h1>Programming Experience </h1>
            <br>
            <h2>My Programming Career started last year, once I entered HBO-ICT here on the HZ Groene Woud.
                I was a very naive person/programmer back then, just sticking to basic concepts that I sometimes didn't even understand.
            </h2>

            <p>
                So especially for you, reader, I have gathered some screenshots from my older site, which I reworked for the biggest part by hand.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               First off, my skill of designing pages and working with CSS has drastically improved since the first year. The design of my site may be simple, but it is also quite effective on avoiding unnessecary work!
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Secondly, the lack of self-esteem in my coding has disappeared. I used to copy paste a lot of code without having the knowledge of using it, which is exactly what SHOULDN'T be done.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Last but not least, my motivation and joy I find in coding nowadays has increased. Even though I don't have the freetime to do so, I can at least show you that I'm passionate about working.
