            <h1>My Motivation/Study Choice</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Back in the early days of entering the study, I chose this study because of it's versatility and more practical way of testing (For instance by having almost no written exams).
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                But now that I look back at it, that isn't the whole reason behind choosing this study.
                <br> <br>
                The real reason that I rejoined this year and didn't choose to drop out, was that I have the sudden urge to prove myself. I am obliged to do so for myself, my parents and to show the teachers like you that I can learn instead of being a useless trashbag sitting in the back of the class.
            </p>

            <p> The second reason why I'm here, is that I really enjoy working in this environment. The way the study is paved is perfect for me, as I feel appreciated and there is always someone that can help out. It makes me wanna work on these tasks, unlike highschool where it felt like just another chore.</p>
