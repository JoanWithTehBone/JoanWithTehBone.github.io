            <p>I'm Jonah and this is my site. Have a look around if you want, not forcing you or anything.</p>

            <p> About a year ago, I have chosen to do a HBO study because of a couple of reasons.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I loved wokring with PC's and Gaming
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was sure I was smart enough to take on these tasks
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was prepared to face anything after stupid highschool!
                </li>
            </ul>
            Of course, HBO-ICT was the perfect choice, because I love to learn by doing stuff, instead of sitting and
            listening for hours.
            </p>
            <p>

                Here is my optimistic view back in 2020: <br>

                "This is also the reason why this study suits me the most. I have noticed the last few days that
                programming isn't that difficult and I like learning
                more about it. PC's have always interested me more than any other subject!"</p>

            <p>That was my biggest downfall, underestimating the study and it's contents. I had never been to a study
                like this before, but alas, here we are once more!

                My current goals for this year is to improve my way of working and making it through year one 'Cum
                Laude'.

                <br><br>
                I am sure that this is achievable, so I hope you will all join in on this journey and have a blast!
            </p>
