            <h1>Hello There</h1>
            <p>I'm Jonah and this is my site. Have a look around if you want, not forcing you or anything.</p>
        
    
            <p> So, about the study: <br> I have chosen to do a HBO study because I didn't wanna do a MBO-study nor stay at school for a couple more yeasr to be able to join University. HBO-ICT was the perfect choice, because I learn by doing stuff instead of sitting and listening. This is also the reason why this study suits me the most. I have noticed the last few days that programming isn't that difficult and I like learning more about it. PC's have always interested me more than any other subject!</p>
