            <p>I'm Jonah and this is my site. Have a look around if you want, not forcing you or anything.</p>

            <p> So, about the study: <br> I have chosen to do a HBO study because I didn't wanna do a MBO-study nor stay
                at school for a couple more yeasr to be able to join University. HBO-ICT was the perfect choice, because
                I learn by doing stuff instead of sitting and listening. This is also the reason why this study suits me
                the most. I have noticed the last few days that programming isn't that difficult and I like learning
                more about it. PC's have always interested me more than any other subject!</p>
